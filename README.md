# My Initial Neovim Config

This repo contains my custom Neovim config, built on top of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). It's designed to provide a clean, modern setup with LSP support, autocomplete, formatting, and everything else you'd expect from a serious Neovim setup.
